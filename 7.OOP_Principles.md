The basic principles of OOPs are 

* Encapsulation 
* Abstraction
* Inheritance 
* Polymorphism


# Encapsulation

* It is the method of restricting direct access to some of our attributes in a program.
* Restricting the ability to override the values for your objects within your saddles.
* A @property is created so that we will have the ability to access the price attribute temporarily being only read only.


# Abstraction

* It only shows the necessary attributes and hides the unnecessary information.
* Like, when we send an email, we have a lot of steps like
        -> connecting to an SMTP server
        -> Content for the mail
        -> Sending the mail
        
* But the user need not be aware of all these steps as these aren't necessary
* Likewise in Python, Abstraction is used to hide these methods.


# Polymorphism

* It is the use of single type entity to represent different types in different scenarios.
* Poly - many; Morphism - Forms

# Inheritance
* It refers to inheriting the property of one class into another
* It reduces reusability
